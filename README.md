GeoPDF_to_GeoTIFF
=================

#####   IMPORTANT   ######   
You must have GDAL and Python installed on your computer for this to work.

Instructions ---->   Drop both the .bat and the .py file into the folder that contains the GeoPDFs that you wish to convert. Open a command prompt within the folder, and type "cutline.bat".  This will run the .bat file which will iterated through each .pdf in the folder and run the .py file against it. The .py file will use the .pdf file as an argument and clip it with the neatline and convert it to a GeoTIFF.
